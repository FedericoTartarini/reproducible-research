   abstract = {© 2017 The Authors. A demographic shift is underway in Australia; the number of people aged 65 and over is rapidly increasing. Regulations have been implemented to enhance the quality of care being provided in nursing homes; however, in the aged care sector there is little by way of guidance addressing design and performance issues in regards to Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), and there is still uncertainty as to the perceptions of residents on specific IEQ factors. The objectives of this study are to determine: how accredited facilities are performing in regards to thermal comfort conditions; how indoor environmental factors can be assessed in a non-intrusive way; and how occupants perceive their thermal environment. Air temperature and relative humidity were monitored over ten months in six nursing homes located in southeast NSW using 305 loggers. Subjective perception of the thermal environment was gathered from 157 residents, 31 family members and 64 staff who completed a questionnaire at the same time that local environmental parameters were monitored. Results show how accredited nursing homes performed in regards to thermal comfort, along with a detailed description of the non-intrusive methodology adopted to assess IEQ factors. Subjective responses of occupants, along with adaptive behaviour strategies employed by participants to counter unsatisfactory thermal conditions, were also examined. This study has practical implications for the aged care sector and provides quantitative evidence on how nursing homes should be designed and operated to enhance satisfaction and well-being of occupants.},

abstract = {Current thermal/sensation models primarily rely on predefined formulas or empirically defined recommendations, but fail to consider each individual's physiological characteristics. Such models frequently ignore occupants' diverse physical conditions and, therefore, have critical limitations in estimating each individual's thermal sensation levels. Since the human body is governed by the thermoregulation principle to balance the heat flux between the ambient thermal condition and the body itself, skin temperature has a significant role in maintaining this physiological principle. Therefore, this study investigated the potential use of skin temperature and its technical parameters in establishing a thermal sensation. By using advanced modern sensing technologies, and existing thermal regulation model research, this study selected and validated seven body areas as significant local body segments for determining overall thermal sensation. A series of environmental chamber tests were conducted for 2 h. While the indoor temperature fluctuated between 20 °C and 30 °C, skin temperatures of the seven selected body areas were measured in conjunction with a thermal sensation and comfort survey. Results of this study revealed that combinations of skin temperatures for the arm, back, and wrist provided the significant information needed to accurately estimate the thermal sensations of each user. Most of all, both sides of the wrist generated accurate data more than 94{\%} of the time. Therefore, considering the modern advanced wearable sensing technologies, results of this study confirmed that optimum combinations of skin temperature information from selected body areas, is reliable and generally applicable for estimating individual thermal sensations.},
